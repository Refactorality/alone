Impossibly, you wake from the salty taste of the ocean water and sand fills your mouth and laps at your cheek. As you lift your head to get your bearings, the sky has cleared and youâ€™re surrounded on one side by a thick copse of evergreen trees that extend up a nearby mountainside, the other an expanse of blue and gray that you somehow survived. Amazingly, you still wear your backpack, and remember that you grabbed several things before you abandoned ship. You wonder if any of your crew-mates survived the capsizing. Could they be somewhere nearby if so?

Your thoughts are superseded by a sudden awareness of your uncontrollable shivering. Your clothes are still soaking wet, as are the items in your pack. What do you want to do?
